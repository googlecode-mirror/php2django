PHP has a lot of well-built code. Django is relatively new, but is gaining speed. Rather than reinvent the wheel, why not borrow code ideas from good working PHP solutions?

This project has one simple aim: To reliably convert good PHP code into syntactically correct python code that can be used by Django projects.

Some clarification:
  * Reliably = 90%+ unaided conversion
  * Good PHP code = Not bad PHP code (sadly, it's out there)
  * Syntactically correct = Python won't complain, even if it's not quite semantically correct (that's up to you to verify)
  * Python = Somewhere around version 2.5
  * Can be used = You may have to do some extra work, but hopefully, this converter will get you most of the way there
  * Django = Somewhere around version 1.2
